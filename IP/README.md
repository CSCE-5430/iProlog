tested with Java 8, developed with IntelliJ and cmd line

##usage:

* go.sh perms

* go.sh queens

or

* go.sh <any pure Prolog program (assumed with suffix .pl) in directory progs>

see

* doc/paper.pdf

and tutorial at

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRYAMt8iQSw&t=82s

for motivations and justification of implementation choices

a swi prolog script first compiles the code to a pl.nl
file, than Main calls stuff in Engine which loads it in memory
and runs it

##### primitive types:

* int
* ground
* var (U+V)
* ref
* array

see main code (~1000lines) in Engine.java

* pl2nl.pro compiles a .pl file to its .nl equivalent, ready to run by
the java based runtime system

* natint.pro emulates its work by compiling back .nl files to Prolog clauses


***** todo:

* design a self-contained compiler
* faster runtime:
    memory efficiency - eg recursive loop, LCO
    code to be mem_copied with ptrs to var/ref cells to be relocated?

* more thoughts

** no symbol tables:

a symbol is just a ground array of ints

instead of a symbol table we would have a "ground cache"

when a non-ground compound tries to unify with a ground, the ground is
expanded to the heap

when a ground unifies with a ground - it's just handle equality
when a var unifies with a ground it just points to it - as if it were a constant
